Coded a AI Agent which can play the Game of checkers .Used minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruining for finding the efficeint move .Heuristic function was based on the number of kills and number of kings. Used tkinter for the simulation of game

#How to Run ??

Just Run the single python file changeHuristic.py after installing all the used packages.
How agent finds the best move to play ??

It uses Mini-Max Algorithm with Alpha–beta pruning to find the next move.
how well does it play ??

It depends on the depth of the search .My computer allowed only till depth 5 and it was doing pretty well on depth 5.
How to make agent smarter??

Just increase the search depth by changing the mxDep variable.
