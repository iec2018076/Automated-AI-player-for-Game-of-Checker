#How to Run ??

Just Run the single python file changeHuristic.py after installing all the used packages.
How agent finds the best move to play ??

It uses Mini-Max Algorithm with Alphaâ€“beta pruning to find the next move.

It depends on the depth of the search .My computer allowed only till depth 5 and it was doing pretty well on depth 5.
How to make agent smarter??

Just increase the search depth by changing the mxDep variable.
